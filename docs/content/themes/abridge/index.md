# Abridge Zola Theme

Abridge is a fast and lightweight Zola theme using semantic html, only ~6kb css before svg icons, no mandatory JS[*](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge#contributing-and-philosophy), and perfect [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabridge.netlify.app) and [Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/abridge.netlify.app) scores.

There is also an [Abridge-minimal](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.css) Theme which is used to showcase the [abridge.css framework](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge.css/tree/master/dist)

## Demo

[https://abridge.netlify.app/](https://abridge.netlify.app/)

## Requirements

This theme requires version 0.14.1 or later of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git
cd abridge
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Installation
The Quick Start shows how to run the theme directly as a site.
Next we will use abridge as a theme to a NEW site.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install abridge

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git themes/abridge
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Enable the theme in your `config.toml` in the site directory:

```toml
theme = "abridge"
```

Or copy the `config.toml` from the theme directory to your project's root directory:
(This will give you a base configuration with all config values used)

```bash
cp themes/abridge/config.toml config.toml
```

Uncomment the theme line, and point extra_syntaxes_and_themes at the correct directory:
```bash
sed -i 's/^#theme = "abridge"/theme = "abridge"/' config.toml
sed -i 's/^extra_syntaxes_and_themes = \["highlight_themes"\]/extra_syntaxes_and_themes = \["highlight_themes", "themes\/abridge\/highlight_themes"\]/' config.toml
```

The result should be:
```toml
theme = "abridge"
[markdown]
extra_syntaxes_and_themes = ["highlight_themes", "themes/abridge/highlight_themes"]
```

### Step 4: Add new content

You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/abridge/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the content directory as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

Zola will start the development web server making your site accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `content` files, and templates files in this
repo for an idea.

### Number of Items per page for pagination

To change the number of items per page edit: `abridge/content/_index.md` and change the value for `paginate_by`

### Page width

You can set the overal page width by editing `themes\abridge\sass\_variables.scss` file, and adjusting these two lines:

```scss
$mw:50% !default;// max-width
$mb:1200px !default;// value at which to switch from fluid layout to using max-width
```

### Colors and Styles

Colors and style are handled by the sass files of [abridge.css](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.css)

Abridge comes with two "Skins" each with their own auto, dark, and light modes.
Auto mode automatically displays a dark or light version depending on browser/OS settings.

The skin used on [the Demo](https://abridge.netlify.app/) uses primarily orange colors.
It is defined here: `/themes/abridge/sass/abridge.scss`

There is also other variations, that you will see defined in this same directory.

To change colors or fonts all you need to do is edit these files or duplicate them and create your own skin.
Then in the root of your site type `zola build` which will regenerate your site, this is similar to what zola serve does, except it does not facilitate serving the site.

### Global Configuration

There are some configuration options that you can customize in `config.toml`.

#### Configuration options before `extra` options

Set the authors's taxonomies for the site.

```toml
taxonomies = [
  {name = "authors"},
]
```

Use search function for the content.

```toml
build_search_index = true
```

â€‹The search is the only thing that requires javascript in this this theme.

If you set `build_search_index` to false then the javascript file will no longer be loaded.

The default elasticlunr search is currently used, I may eventually switch this out for something else.

#### Configuration options under the `extra`

Most Options in the config.toml are self documenting, meaning between the name of the config value and the notes in the file it is usually obvious what an option is for.

The following options should be under the `[extra]` in `config.toml`

- `language_code` - Set the site language_code.
- `title_separator` - Separator between title and title_addition, eg "|": "Abridge | Fast & Lightweight Zola Theme"
- `title_addition` - a default value for title addition, used at the index.

- `author` - Used for articles to denote the author.
- `author_show = true` - Displays the author name on line with date, tags, categories
- `readtime = true` - Displays the read time on line with date, tags, categories.
- `readtime_string` - The word following the read time, you can set this to "min", "minutes", "min read", etc.
- `recent = true` - This enabled the Recent posts box visible on the top right.
- `recent_items = 9` - The number of items to display in the recent posts box
- `footer_credit = true` - This enables the powered by zola and abridge line in the footer.
- `footer_credit_override` - Can be used to customize the footer credit, useful to add icons to the text, etc.

- `logo = { file="logo.svg", width="42", height="42", alt="Abridge", text="bridge" }` - Defines the graphical logo with optional text to follow the logo.
- `textlogo` - A purely Text based logo, this will be used if logo is commented out, if both are commented out then config.title is used.
- `sitedesc` - This add the site description just below the text based logo.
- `copyright_start_year` - Optionally define a start year for the copyright, otherwise the current year is used.
- `copyright_end_year` - Optionally set the copyright end year, recommend leaving unset, zola build will set this to current year by default
- `headhr` - Display a horizontal rule below header
- `foothr` - Display a horizontal rule above footer
- `menu` - This is an array of links to display at the top right corner of the page
- `menu_footer` - This is an array of links to display in the footer of the page

- `security_header_referrer` - This is mostly used for tracking, the default is set to "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" [info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
- `security_header_csp` - Content Security policy, to enfore security rules: [observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org) [csp-google](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)

- `banner` - Image to use in seo related cards, this will be the fallback image if the individual articles does not provide one, still a work in progress.
- `js_search_index = "search_index.en.js"` - The search index file to include in the header, comment out to disable.
- `js_search = "search.min.js"` - The search script file to include in the header, comment out to disable.
- `rss_atom_feed = "atom.xml"` - The atom.xml rss file to include in the header.
- `stylesheet = "abridge.css"` - The stylesheet file to include in the header.
- `fontawesome =` - Uncomment to enable fontawesome library, this will include the file in the header.
- `fonts =` - Uncomment to load external fonts, they will be loaded in the header.
- `math` - Set to true to load the Katex library, enabling the use of the [katex shortcode](https://abridge.netlify.app/overview-math/)
- `math_auto_render` - This allows you to define a section of math notation using only $$ $$ symbols instead of using the katex shortcode directly.

- `keywords =` - This is used for SEO.
- `seo =` - This is used for SEO, for the social media related tags, eg: opengraph, facebook, twitter if set to false it disables them all.
- `extra.social` - These are the options for the social icons in the footer, and a couple are also used in SEO related meta tags.

Additionally you should configure which social icons you plan to use. (makes the css file size smaller)

open `themes/abridge/sass/_variables.scss`

To simply turn them all off you can set `$enable-icons: false`
Otherwise to turn on only the ones you need you would set `$enable-icons: true`
Then enable only the icons you need, eg for mail you would set `$icon-mail: true`
You should then disable all the icons that you do not use, as this will decrease the final size of your css file.
The difference in size is NOT a lot, without icons its ~4kb, with all the social icons its ~12kb.
There are also some general purpose icons you can use, they are disabled by default.

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", rss = true},
    {name = "tags", rss = true},
]
```

### Top and Footer menus
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `menu` and `menu_footer`.
If a link should have a trailing slash at the end of the url set `slash = true`.

```toml
# This is the default menu
menu = [
    {url = "/", name = "Home", slash = true},
    {url = "/about/", name = "About", slash = true},
    {url = "/posts/", name = "Posts", slash = true},
    {url = "/categories/", name = "Categories", slash = true},
    {url = "/tags/", name = "Tags", slash = true},
]
menu_footer = [
    {url = "/", name = "Home", slash = true},
    {url = "/about/", name = "About", slash = true},
    {url = "/contact/", name = "Contact", slash = true},
    {url = "/privacy/", name = "Privacy", slash = true},
    {url = "/sitemap.xml", name = "Sitemap", slash = false},
]
```

### SEO and Header Tags

Most SEO Tags have been added as well as some important head tags for browser compatibility.

You can review the SEO tags in the head macro located at `templates/macros/head.html`, all configurable values should be in config.toml under config.extra or in the content markdown files.

In your post markdown file you should set a title less than 60 characters and a description between 80 and 160 characters in length. The description is what is displayed in search results below the page title. Anywhere that you do not set a page description, the primary site config.description will be used instead.

You should also set page specific keywords unless your keywords defined in config.toml suffice, any keywords that you add to the page are in addition to the ones defined in config.toml, so do not add those same keywords to your page keywords.

You can optionally also set a page specific image for search results by using page.extra.thumbnail. OpenGraph recommends 1200 x 630 (1.9:1). Twitter recommends 2:1 for large and 1:1 for small. If you do not set a page specific thumbnail then the banner defined in config.toml will be used instead.

Refer to [overview-images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jieiku/abridge/master/content/overview-images/index.md) for an example:
```md
+++
title = "Image Shortcodes"
description = "Images can be embeded directly using markdown `![Ferris](ferris.svg)`, but using a shortcode prevents CLS by explicitly setting the width and height."
date = 2021-05-19

[taxonomies]
categories = ["Features"]
tags = ["shortcodes","images"]
[extra]
toc = true
keywords = "Image, Markdown, Shortcodes, Hover"
thumbnail = "ferris-gesture.png"
+++
```

There are tools you can use to test your page SEO metadata, such as: [smallseotools.com](https://smallseotools.com/meta-tags-analyzer/)

### KaTeX and CSP

KaTeX unfortunately requires `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` in the Content Security Policy. This is a security vulnerability, so the demo site will not render KaTeX correctly because the demo site uses best security practices.

KaTeX js is designed to work even with dynamic content, but because Zola is a SSG it seems to me the best solution is to avoid using this javascript all-together, process our markdown files similar to how KaTeX autorender does, but do it during zola build. insert some `<span class="KaTeX_Main">` ...etc so that we basically render it during the build process. If complex mathematics were part of my daily life then I might be motivated to write such code for Zola.

You will also see [this page](https://abridge.netlify.app/overview-math/) rendered correctly if you git clone this repo and use zola serve because then there will be no Content Security Policy in place.

### Templates

All pages extend to `base.html`, and you can customize them as need.

## Optional Optimizations:

### Optimize PNG files:

All png files can be optimized using [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng), this usually results in files 1/2 the size:

```bash
cd static
oxipng -o max --strip all -a -Z *.png
```

### Consolidate two search js files into one:

Optionally you can serve a single js file for the search instead of a separate index by combining the two:
(although I am not sure how to accomplish this if your using the theme as a submodule, maybe you can use a git action for this command depending on your hosting provider.)

First comment out this line in config.toml:

```toml
#js_search_index ="search_index.en.js
```

Then build and uglifyjs:
```bash
zola build
uglifyjs search_index.en.js search.min.js -o search.min.js -c -m
```

### Pre gzip content to serve with nginx:

If you are serving your site with nginx, you can pre gzip your content.

First configure nginx:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
#gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 9;
gzip_buffers 64 16k;
#gzip_buffers 16 8k;
gzip_http_version 1.1;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript image/svg+xml application/xhtml+xml application/x-javascript application/x-font-ttf application/vnd.ms-fontobject font/opentype font/ttf font/eot font/otf;
#gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
```

Then you can gzip your files:
```bash
zola build
find ./public -type f -regextype posix-extended -regex '.*\.(htm|html|css|js|xml|xsl|txt|woff|woff2|svg|otf|eot|ttf)' -exec gzip -k -9 -f {} \;
```

## Contributing and Philosophy

We'd love your help! Especially with fixes to issues.

The overall idea behind abridge is to be lightweight and fast, and to work properly even if javascript is disabled.

The only feature that some people may consider a necessity that relies on javascript is the Search.

Any feature added to abridge that relies on javascript will do so with it disabled by default.
